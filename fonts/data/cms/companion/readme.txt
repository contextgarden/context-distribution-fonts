The ConTeXt math companion fonts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These files fix and/or enhance some math glyphs and are loaded in the math font
goodie files used by ConTeXt LMTX. They are meant to be used alongside the main
math fonts that are frozen. The fonts were developed as part of an overhaul of
OpenType math in LuaMetaTeX and LMTX.

On 2024-11-01 the file names were changed and some name fields were removed in
order to bypass a bug in XeTeX/LaTeX math font definitions / lookups, where the
family name is used for math fonts instead of the full font name. The ConTeXt
goodie files have been adapted accordingly.

The file names are:

LatinModernMathCompanion-Regular.otf
RalphSmithsFormalScriptCompanion-Regular.otf
TeXGyreBonumMathCompanion-Regular.otf
TeXGyrePagellaMathCompanion-Regular.otf
TeXGyreTermesMathCompanion-Regular.otf
XITSMathCompanion-Regular.otf
